          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <h2>1. Data protection at a glance</h2>

            <h3>General information</h3>
            <p>The following notes provide a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit this website. Personal data means all data that can be used to personally identify you. Detailed information on data protection can be found in the privacy policy set out below.</p>

            <h3>Data collection on this website</h3>

            <h4>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</h4>
            <p>Data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find the operator’s contact details in the section “Note on the controller” in this privacy policy.</p>

            <h4>How do we collect your data?</h4>
            <p>On the one hand, your data is collected when you provide it to us. This may, for example, be data that you enter in a contact form.</p>
            <p>Other data is collected automatically or after your consent when you visit the website by our IT systems. This is mainly technical data (e.g. internet browser, operating system or time of page access). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter this website.</p>

            <h4>What do we use your data for?</h4>
            <p>Part of the data is collected to ensure error‑free provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyze user behavior. If contracts can be concluded or initiated via the website, the transmitted data will also be processed for contractual offers, orders or other requests.</p>

            <h4>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h4>
            <p>You have the right to receive information free of charge at any time about the origin, recipients, and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have the right to request the rectification or deletion of this data. If you have given consent to data processing, you may revoke this consent at any time with effect for the future. Furthermore, you have the right, under certain circumstances, to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.</p>
            <p>You can contact us at any time regarding this and any other questions on the subject of data protection.</p>

            <h3>Analytics tools and third‑party tools</h3>
            <p>When visiting this website, your surfing behavior may be statistically evaluated. This is done primarily with so‑called analysis programs.</p>
            <p>Detailed information on these analysis programs can be found in the privacy policy below.</p>

            <h2>2. Hosting</h2>
            <p>We host the content of our website with the following provider:</p>

            <h3>External hosting</h3>
            <p>This website is hosted externally. The personal data collected on this website is stored on the servers of the hosting provider(s). This may include, in particular, IP addresses, contact requests, meta and communication data, contract data, contact details, names, website access data and other data generated via a website.</p>
            <p>External hosting is carried out for the purpose of fulfilling contracts with our potential and existing users (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) and in the interest of a secure, fast and efficient provision of our online offering by a professional provider (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). Where consent has been requested, processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and Section 25(1) TDDDG, insofar as consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information on the user’s device (e.g. device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. Consent can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
            <p>Our hosting provider(s) will only process your data to the extent necessary to fulfill its performance obligations and will follow our instructions with regard to this data.</p>
            <p>We use the following hosting provider(s):</p>
            <p>[Name and full address of the hosting provider]</p>

            <h2>3. General notes and mandatory information</h2>

            <h3>Data protection</h3>
            <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
            <p>When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>
            <p>We point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by email) may have security gaps. Complete protection of the data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>

            <h3>Note on the controller</h3>
            <p>The controller responsible for data processing on this website is:</p>
            <p>
              Lucas Graf<br>
              Weißestraße 36<br>
              04299 Leipzig, Germany
            </p>
            <p>
              Phone: 0170 1251262<br>
              Email: lucasgraf01@gmail.com
            </p>
            <p>The controller is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

            <h3>Storage period</h3>
            <p>Unless a more specific storage period is specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for the data processing no longer applies. If you make a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, deletion takes place after these reasons no longer apply.</p>

            <h3>General information on the legal bases of data processing on this website</h3>
            <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories of data pursuant to Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access to information in your end device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally based on Section 25(1) TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the performance of a contract or pre‑contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The relevant legal bases applicable in each individual case are explained in the following sections of this privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
            <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This may also involve the transfer of personal data to such external parties. We only pass on personal data if this is necessary for the performance of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g. transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only transfer personal data of our users on the basis of a valid data processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint controller agreement is concluded.</p>

            <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
            <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The lawfulness of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

            <h3>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
            <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT, ON GROUNDS RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
            <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p>

            <h3>Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</h3>
            <p>In the event of infringements of the GDPR, data subjects shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

            <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
            <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine‑readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>

            <h3>Access, rectification, and erasure</h3>
            <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to obtain information free of charge about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to rectification or erasure of this data. You can contact us at any time regarding this and other questions on the subject of personal data.</p>

            <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
              <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.</li>
              <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its erasure.</li>
              <li>If you have objected pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – aside from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>

            <h3>SSL/TLS encryption</h3>
            <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as requests that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from “http://” to “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
            <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

            <h3>Objection to advertising emails</h3>
            <p>The use of contact data published within the scope of the legal notice obligations for the purpose of sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby objected to. The operators of these pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, for example through spam emails.</p>

            <h2>4. Data collection on this website</h2>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>Our internet pages use so‑called “cookies”. Cookies are small data packages that do not cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them yourself or your web browser automatically deletes them.</p>
            <p>Cookies can originate from us (first‑party cookies) or from third‑party companies (so‑called third‑party cookies). Third‑party cookies enable the integration of certain services of third‑party companies within websites (e.g. cookies for processing payment services).</p>
            <p>Cookies have various functions. Numerous cookies are technically necessary because certain website functions would not work without them (e.g. login status or the display of videos). Other cookies can be used to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes.</p>
            <p>Cookies that are necessary for the electronic communication process, to provide certain functions you have requested (e.g. login) or to optimize the website (e.g. audience measurement) (necessary cookies) are stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of necessary cookies for the technically error‑free and optimized provision of its services. If consent to the storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies has been requested, processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of this consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and Section 25(1) TDDDG); consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
            <p>You can set your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and to allow cookies only in individual cases, to exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general, and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be restricted.</p>
            <p>You can find which cookies and services are used on this website in this privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>Server log files</h3>
            <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so‑called server log files that your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Browser type and version</li>
              <li>Operating system used</li>
              <li>Referrer URL</li>
              <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
              <li>Time of the server request</li>
              <li>IP address</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data will not be combined with other data sources.</p>
            <p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error‑free presentation and optimization of the website – for this purpose, the server log files must be collected.</p>

            <h3>Contact form</h3>
            <p>If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provide there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow‑up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
            <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre‑contractual measures. In all other cases, processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if requested; consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
            <p>The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>

            <h3>Request by email, telephone or fax</h3>
            <p>If you contact us by email, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
            <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre‑contractual measures. In all other cases, processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if requested; consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
            <p>The data sent by you to us via contact requests will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular statutory retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>

            <h3>User registration on this website</h3>
            <p>You can create a demo account to use the Join kanban application. For this purpose, we process the data you provide during registration (e.g. name, email address and password). Passwords are never stored by us in plain text. We use an authentication service (Firebase Authentication by Google), the service processes your login data on our behalf and provides us with a user ID and basic profile data.</p>
            <p>The legal basis is your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). In addition, processing may be necessary for the performance of a (demo) usage agreement (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR), as registration is required to use core functions (e.g. saving tasks/boards).</p>
            <p>Mandatory information requested during registration must be provided in full; otherwise, registration will be rejected. We use the data solely to provide and administer your account and the demo functions. We do not disclose this data to third parties unless there is a legal obligation or you have given consent.</p>
            <p>Data retention: We store your account data until you delete your account or request deletion. We also reserve the right to regularly delete inactive demo accounts and associated content after a reasonable period in order to keep the demo instance clean.</p>
            <p>Social login: If social login (e.g. “Sign in with Google”) is offered and used, the respective provider will transmit the information required for authentication to us (e.g. email address, name, profile picture). The data transfer and further processing by the provider is governed by the provider’s own privacy policy. Use of social login is voluntary.</p>
            <p>Deletion of the account: You can request deletion of your account at any time by contacting us via the contact options provided in this privacy policy.</p>
